# Google-Places-Autocomplete

My mini-implementation of Google places autocomplete service with CRA!

## Installation
You'll need to make a copy of the `.env.example` and rename it `.env`. Then generate an API key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/). Once that is done, add it to the `.env` as a value for the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` before starting the application.

Once that is done, you'll follow these steps:

- Install dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn` command.
- start the application with `npm start` or `yarn start`
